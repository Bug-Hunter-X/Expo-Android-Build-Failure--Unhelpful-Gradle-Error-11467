The solution to this issue likely involves a careful examination of the full Gradle error log to pinpoint the problematic dependency or configuration setting.  The fix may require several steps, including:

1. **Cleaning the build:**  Try `./gradlew clean` from the `android` directory to ensure a fresh build.
2. **Updating dependencies:** Run `expo update` to update all packages in your project. Pay close attention to the Gradle plugin version.
3. **Inspecting the full Gradle log:** The verbose Gradle output can provide more clues. Examine it for specific error messages, warnings, or exceptions.  Consider searching for specific error messages online.
4. **Investigating dependency conflicts:** Use tools or techniques to identify potential conflicts in your `package.json` dependencies and their transitive dependencies. This could involve analyzing the Gradle dependency tree.
5. **Updating Expo CLI:** Ensure that you're using the latest version of the Expo CLI. This often resolves compatibility issues.
6. **Creating a Minimal Reproducible Example:** If you can't resolve the issue, consider creating the simplest possible Expo project that still reproduces the error.  This makes it easier to share and debug.
7. **Community Support:** Seek help on the Expo forums or other relevant communities.  Providing the full Gradle error log will be essential.
